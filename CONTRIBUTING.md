# Contributing

We are happy to see your interest in conteributing to the project. 

## Branches

To easily identify branches, we encourage you to use the following branch naming convention. Start with the category (outlined below), followed by the issue number (if available), and finally a descriptive name for the branch.

`category/issue_number/branch_name`

These are the categories.

### Feature branches

Used for new features, that do not exist yet.

`feature/123/user-login`

### Bug fix branches

Used for bugs that will be fixed in an upcoming release.

`bugfix/1342/picture-not-displayed`

### Hot fix branches

Used for bugs that need to be fixed immediately and cannot wait until next release.

`hotfix/1523/login-issue`

### Documentation
Used for branches concerning solely the documentation of the project. Ideally documentation changes are carried out together with the implementation of what is documented, but in case that is not possible, use the docs category.

`docs/add-contributing-guidelines`

### Experimental

Branches with experimental features, that will most likely not be merged. Once a feature in and experimental branch has been validated, it can be moved to a feature branch.

`exp/implement-flux-capacitor`

### Work in progress

Branches containing longer term work in progress, that has been started on but will not be finished anytime soon.

`wip/add-camera-tests`
